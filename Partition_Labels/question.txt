You are given a string s consisting of lowercase english letters.

We want to split the string into as many substrings as possible, while ensuring that each letter appears in at most one substring.

Return a list of integers representing the size of these substrings in the order they appear in the string.

Example 1:

Input: s = "xyxxyzbzbbisl"

Output: [5, 5, 1, 1, 1]
Explanation: The string can be split into ["xyxxy", "zbzbb", "i", "s", "l"].

Example 2:

Input: s = "abcabc"

Output: [6]
Constraints:

1 <= s.length <= 100
